## Introduction

The Animal Behavior Simulation Project is a coding exercise designed to explore scripting and simulation techniques. Initially, the project focuses on simulating the behavior of sheep within a virtual environment. However, the long-term goal is to expand this project to include simulations of various animals, such as dogs, wolves, and other creatures.

## Features

- Sheep simulation: Simulates the behavior of sheep within a virtual environment.
- Extensible architecture: The project is designed to be easily extendable to incorporate simulations of other animals.
- Educational: Ideal for individuals looking to gain experience with scripting and simulation techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Animal Behavior Simulation Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build Typescript project.
4. Launch it in a local server.
